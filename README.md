## 🚀 Vision

The reselling market is booming, but resellers often rely on messy spreadsheets and fragmented tools to manage thousands of dollars in inventory. **FlipTrack** unifies the entire workflow into a single, cohesive dashboard. It is a feature-complete, modern alternative to existing premium trackers, fully open-sourced for the community. 

Whether you are flipping 10 pairs a month or running a massive consignment operation, FlipTrack scales with your business logic.

    Track every item with granular details including SKU, size, condition, purchase price, purchase date, and real-time status (`IN_STOCK`, `LISTED`, `SOLD`).

    Automated background scraping (via API cron jobs) of real-time market prices across secondary platforms to keep your portfolio valuation accurate.
*   🧠 **Generative AI Insights**

    Log sales, track platform/shipping fees, and generate detailed P&L (Profit & Loss) statements instantly.

*   ✨ **Premium Glassmorphic UI**

## 🏃 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the FlipTrack development environment locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed and configured on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or higher)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (for Postgres DB and Auth)
*   A [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) API key (for AI features)

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushikesh-bobade/FlipTrack.git
   cd FlipTrack
   ```

2. **Install NPM dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example` (if provided), and populate it:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
   DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_transaction_pooler_url"
   DIRECT_URL="your_supabase_session_url"
   
   # Groq AI
   GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
   ```

### Database Setup

Sync your Prisma schema with your Supabase Postgres instance and generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

Start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 💡 Demo Credentials

Want to test FlipTrack's UI and features without manually creating data? We have included an automated seed script that provisions a test user and sample sneaker inventory.

1. Ensure your development server is running (`npm run dev`).
2. Execute the demo creation script:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/create-demo-user.ts
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/auth/login`.
4. Click the **"Use Demo Credentials"** button on the login form to instantly authenticate and view the populated dashboard.
